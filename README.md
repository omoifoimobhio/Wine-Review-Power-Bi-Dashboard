# Wine-Review-Power-Bi-Dashboard
I created a #PowerBi dashboard analyzing a dataset consisting of wine reviews across countries and these were the insights drawn:

-Number of countries, wineries and varieties
-Count of tasters
-The minimum,maximum and average prices of wines
-Top Ten Most expensive wines by average prices
-Top Ten Least Expensive wines by average prices
-Top ten varieties of wines by their average points
--Top ten testers by wine count
